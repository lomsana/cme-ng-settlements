# Quantitative Research - Natural Gas Price Modeling

This project analyzes monthly end-of-month natural gas prices from October 2020 to September 2024 to support the pricing of commodity storage contracts. The data is cleaned and transformed into a continuous price curve to estimate prices for any historical date and to extrapolate prices one year into the future.
Seasonal patterns and trends in natural gas prices are explored through visualization and simple statistical modeling. The final output is a pricing function that takes a date as input and returns an estimated natural gas price, implemented in Python using standard data analysis tools.
